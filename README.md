Learning TypeScript Project


Just a small project to help me learn TypeScript

Working example of integrating TypeScript with GulpJS

Uses RequireJs to handle asny loading of scripts and dependencies (allows for import / export of classes)



to run: 
gulp watch 



Don't forget to do npm install first :)
